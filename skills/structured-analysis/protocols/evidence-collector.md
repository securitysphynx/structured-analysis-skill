# Evidence Collector Protocol

Gather, rate, and organize evidence across three tiers. Every item must be cited. Uncited claims are not permitted.

---

## Evidence Tiers

Collect in order. Each tier adds breadth.

### Tier 1: Conversation Context
- Extract claims, data, constraints, and assumptions from conversation history
- Tag each item: `[User-provided, session context]`

### Tier 2: Local Files
- Read files the user referenced or attached
- Use Glob to discover relevant files in the working directory
- Tag each item: `[filename:line_range]`

### Tier 3: OSINT (skip if `--no-osint` flag is set)

> **Important — MCP tool availability in sub-agents**:
> - **Background sub-agents** (`run_in_background: true`): MCP tools are **not available**. This is a Claude Code architectural constraint.
> - **Foreground sub-agents**: MCP tools **are** inherited from the parent conversation and will work, but they block the main conversation while running.

Collect OSINT via a three-step pipeline that keeps raw web content out of the main context window. All raw article text is written to disk by subagents; only compact summaries flow back.

#### Step 3a — Raw Collection (Foreground Task Subagents)

Spawn **3 foreground Task subagents sequentially** (one per search theme). Each subagent inherits MCP tools from the parent and can use Firecrawl or WebSearch/WebFetch.

For each theme, invoke the Task tool with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` and the following prompt template (substitute `{{THEME_NAME}}`, `{{THEME_NUMBER}}`, `{{SEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS}}`, and `{{PROBLEM_SUMMARY}}`):

```
You are an OSINT evidence collector. Your task:

1. Search for: {{SEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS}} related to: {{PROBLEM_SUMMARY}}
2. For each relevant result (aim for {{SOURCE_COUNT}} sources):
   - Use firecrawl_search for discovery, then firecrawl_scrape for full content
   - If Firecrawl is unavailable, use WebSearch for discovery + WebFetch for content
   - If ALL web tools are denied, write a file noting the limitation and return
3. Write ALL raw scraped content to: analyses/{{ANALYSIS_ID}}/working/osint-raw/theme-{{THEME_NUMBER}}-{{THEME_SLUG}}.md

Use this file format:
# OSINT Raw: Theme {{THEME_NUMBER}} — {{THEME_NAME}}
> Query: [your search query]
> Timestamp: [ISO timestamp]
> Tool: [firecrawl_search + firecrawl_scrape | WebSearch + WebFetch]

---

## Source 1
- **URL**: [url]
- **Title**: [title]
- **Retrieved**: YYYY-MM-DD

### Raw Content
[Full scraped article content]

---

(Repeat for each source)

4. Return ONLY this summary (nothing else):
   Sources found: [N]
   URLs: [url1], [url2], ...
   Errors: [any errors or "none"]
```

**Theme prompts** (substitute into `{{SEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS}}` and `{{SOURCE_COUNT}}`):

| Theme | `{{THEME_NAME}}` | `{{THEME_SLUG}}` | `{{SEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS}}` | `{{SOURCE_COUNT}}` |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Background & Context | background | Authoritative sources, data, and expert analysis on | 3-5 |
| 2 | Contrarian & Critical | contrarian | Counterarguments, failures, risks, critics' views, and alternative explanations for | 2-3 |
| 3 | Recent Developments | recent | Developments from the last 6 months — new data, policy changes, market shifts, emerging trends, breaking news about | 2-3 |

#### Step 3b — Evidence Extraction (Background Subagents)

After all 3 raw files are on disk, spawn **3 background Task subagents in parallel** (`run_in_background: true`). Each reads its raw file (no MCP tools needed) and extracts structured evidence.

For each theme, invoke the Task tool with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`, `run_in_background: true`, and this prompt template:

```
You are an evidence extraction processor. Your task:

1. Read the raw OSINT file: analyses/{{ANALYSIS_ID}}/working/osint-raw/theme-{{THEME_NUMBER}}-{{THEME_SLUG}}.md
2. For each source in the file, extract structured evidence items:
   - One-sentence summary of key finding
   - Key quotes (direct quotes from the source)
   - Quality ratings using this scale:
     Source Reliability: High (established, verified track record) | Medium (known but unverified) | Low (unknown or biased)
     Information Credibility: High (corroborated, consistent) | Medium (plausible, partial) | Low (uncorroborated, contradictory)
     Diagnostic Value: High (contradicts hypotheses) | Medium (supports some) | Low (consistent with most) | Zero (consistent with ALL)
3. Write structured output to: analyses/{{ANALYSIS_ID}}/working/osint-processed/theme-{{THEME_NUMBER}}-evidence.md

Use this file format:
# Processed Evidence: Theme {{THEME_NUMBER}} — {{THEME_NAME}}

## E-T{{THEME_NUMBER}}-01
- **Source**: [Publication Name]
- **Type**: OSINT
- **Summary**: [One-sentence summary]
- **Key Quotes**: "[Direct quote]"
- **Reliability**: [High | Medium | Low]
- **Credibility**: [High | Medium | Low]
- **Diagnostic Value**: [High | Medium | Low | Zero]
- **Citation**: [Source Title](URL) — Retrieved: YYYY-MM-DD

(Repeat for each evidence item)

## Theme Summary
- Items: [count]
- Reliability distribution: [N] High, [N] Medium, [N] Low
- Diagnostic value distribution: [N] High, [N] Medium, [N] Low, [N] Zero

4. Return ONLY this summary:
   Items extracted: [N]
   Reliability: [N] High, [N] Medium, [N] Low
```

#### Step 3c — Registry Integration (Main Context)

After all background subagents complete:

1. Read the 3 processed evidence files from `working/osint-processed/`
2. Merge with Tier 1 (conversation) and Tier 2 (local files) evidence
3. Assign sequential E-IDs (E01, E02, ...) across all tiers
4. Record which collection method was used (Firecrawl or WebSearch/WebFetch)
5. Run the **Evidence Sufficiency Gate** (see below)
6. Write the final `evidence-registry.md`

#### Error Handling

- **Firecrawl unavailable**: Step 3a subagents fall back to WebSearch + WebFetch automatically. After the analysis completes, display this setup suggestion in the conversation:
  ```
  💡 **Tip**: This analysis used WebSearch/WebFetch for evidence gathering. For faster, more reliable OSINT with richer content extraction, set up Firecrawl:

  claude mcp add firecrawl -e FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your-api-key -- npx -y firecrawl-mcp

  See the project README for full setup instructions.
  ```
  Only show this once per session — do not repeat on subsequent technique runs or iterations.
- **All web tools denied**: Step 3a subagent writes an empty raw file with limitation note; proceed with Tier 1 + Tier 2 only
- **Partial scrape failure**: Step 3b processes whatever sources are present in the raw file
- **Sufficiency Gate retry**: Spawn additional Step 3a subagents with broadened search terms; prior raw files remain on disk

### Tool Permissions

For OSINT to work, the user must whitelist the relevant tools. These permissions are inherited by foreground Task subagents (Step 3a). Add the following to `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "mcp__firecrawl__firecrawl_search",
      "mcp__firecrawl__firecrawl_scrape"
    ]
  }
}
```

Or, if using WebSearch/WebFetch as fallback:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "WebSearch",
      "WebFetch"
    ]
  }
}
```

See the project README for full setup instructions.

## Evidence Sufficiency Gate

After collecting evidence across all tiers, evaluate before proceeding to technique execution. This gate prevents analysis from running against an inadequate evidence base.

### Hard Checks (HALT if failed)

| Check | Threshold | Action on Failure |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Minimum count** | ≥5 items total (≥8 if adaptive mode with 4+ techniques) | Loop back: retry OSINT with broader search terms, try alternative tools, or surface to analyst with specific gap description |
| **Quality floor** | <50% of items rated Low reliability | Halt and surface to analyst: "Evidence base is unreliable — {{N}} of {{TOTAL}} items are Low reliability. Recommend gathering higher-quality sources before proceeding." |

### Soft Checks (WARN and proceed with flag)

| Check | Threshold | Flag Text |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| **Source diversity** | ≥2 distinct source types (e.g., government + journalism + think tank) | `⚠️ LOW SOURCE DIVERSITY: {{N}} source type(s) only. Risk of systematic bias.` |
| **Tier coverage** | At least Tier 1 + one of Tier 2 or 3 populated | `⚠️ SINGLE-TIER EVIDENCE: Only {{TIER}} evidence collected. Consider gathering from additional tiers.` |
| **Diagnostic coverage** | ≥1 item rated High diagnostic value | `⚠️ LOW DIAGNOSTIC POWER: No High-diagnostic evidence found. Evidence may not discriminate between hypotheses.` |
| **Temporal recency** | ≥1 item from the last 6 months (if topic is current/evolving) | `⚠️ STALE EVIDENCE: No recent sources. Analysis may miss current developments.` |

### Gate Logic

```
IF any hard check fails:
    → Attempt one retry cycle (broaden search terms, try fallback tools)
    → If still fails after retry: surface to analyst with specific gap description
    → Analyst can override with explicit approval ("proceed with limited evidence")

IF only soft checks fail:
    → Log all flags in meta.md under Self-Correction > Layer 1 Flags
    → Proceed to technique execution
    → Flags are surfaced again in Layer 2 self-critique and Human Review Gate
```

### Sufficiency Report

After the gate, report to the orchestrator:

```
## Evidence Sufficiency Assessment
- **Total items**: {{COUNT}} (Hard check: {{PASS/FAIL}})
- **Quality floor**: {{HIGH_COUNT}} High / {{MED_COUNT}} Medium / {{LOW_COUNT}} Low (Hard check: {{PASS/FAIL}})
- **Source diversity**: {{TYPE_COUNT}} source types (Soft check: {{PASS/WARN}})
- **Tier coverage**: Tier 1: {{T1}} / Tier 2: {{T2}} / Tier 3: {{T3}} (Soft check: {{PASS/WARN}})
- **Diagnostic power**: {{HIGH_DIAG_COUNT}} High-diagnostic items (Soft check: {{PASS/WARN}})
- **Temporal recency**: Most recent item from {{DATE}} (Soft check: {{PASS/WARN}})
- **Gate result**: {{PROCEED / RETRY / HALT}}
- **Active flags**: {{LIST_OF_FLAGS}}
```

---

## Evidence Quality Rating

Rate every evidence item on three dimensions (per 2009 Primer Quality of Information Check):

**Source Reliability:**
- **High**: Established source with verified track record
- **Medium**: Known source but independently unverified
- **Low**: Unknown source or potential bias identified

**Information Credibility:**
- **High**: Corroborated by independent sources, internally consistent
- **Medium**: Plausible and partially confirmed
- **Low**: Uncorroborated, contradictory, or single-source

**Diagnostic Value:**
- **High**: Contradicts one or more specific hypotheses
- **Medium**: Supports some hypotheses, neutral for others
- **Low**: Consistent with most hypotheses
- **Zero**: Consistent with ALL hypotheses — explicitly flag per Law of Diagnostic Dominance

---

## Citation Format

Every evidence item MUST include:

| Field | Format |
|-------|--------|
| OSINT | `[Source Title](URL)` — Retrieved: YYYY-MM-DD |
| File | `[filename:line_range]` |
| User | `[User-provided, session context]` |
| Analysis | `[Derived via {{TECHNIQUE_NAME}}]` |

**Rules:**
- OSINT is NEVER presented as fact — always "according to [source]"
- Every claim in every artifact must trace to at least one evidence item
- If `--no-osint` is set, note in registry: "OSINT collection disabled by analyst"

---

## Output

Write the completed evidence registry to `analyses/{{ANALYSIS_ID}}/evidence-registry.md` using the evidence registry template.

Report to the orchestrator:
- Total evidence items collected per tier
- Evidence gaps identified (domains with no coverage)
- Diagnostic value distribution (how many High vs Zero items)
