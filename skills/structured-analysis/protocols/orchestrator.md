# Orchestrator Protocol

Route modes, select techniques, and manage the analysis workflow.

---

## Mode Detection

Parse the skill invocation arguments:

| Input | Mode |
|-------|------|
| No args | **Adaptive** — auto-select techniques |
| Technique name (e.g., `ach`, `kac`) | **Direct** — run single technique |
| `--guided` | **Guided** — walk through all phases |
| `--resume <id>` | **Resume** — continue or update existing analysis |
| `--iterate <id>` | **Iterate** — re-run with artifact versioning and evidence delta |
| `--iterate <id> <technique>` | **Iterate (scoped)** — re-run specific technique(s) only |
| `--lean` | **Lean** — Problem Restatement + KAC + Inconsistencies only (overrides rubric) |
| `--comprehensive` | **Comprehensive** — full 14-question rubric, no technique cap, unlocks adversarial + deception checks |
| `--no-osint` | Flag — disable web research |

Flags combine with modes: `--guided --no-osint` is valid.

### Mode Flag Conflict Resolution

| Combination | Resolution |
|---|---|
| `--lean` + `--comprehensive` | ERROR: conflicting effort levels — prompt user to choose |
| `--lean` + `--guided` | Lean overrides technique selection; guided phases still execute |
| `--comprehensive` + `--guided` | Both apply: full rubric + phased execution |
| `--no-osint` + any mode | OSINT disabled; all modes respect this |

## Analysis Directory Setup

At the start of ANY analysis:

1. Generate analysis ID: `YYYY-MM-DD-<slugified-problem-title>`
2. Create directories:
   - `analyses/{{ANALYSIS_ID}}/working/` — technique artifacts
   - `analyses/{{ANALYSIS_ID}}/working/osint-raw/` — raw scraped content (Step 3a output)
   - `analyses/{{ANALYSIS_ID}}/working/osint-processed/` — extracted evidence items (Step 3b output)
3. Write initial `meta.md` using `templates/meta-template.md`
4. Note the analysis directory path — all artifacts go here

---

## Adaptive Mode Selection Logic

### Step 1 — Trigger Check

Ask these questions about the problem:
- Is this high-consequence? (significant risk, resource allocation, strategic implications)
- Is there persistent uncertainty? (incomplete, ambiguous, contradictory data)
- External scrutiny expected? (output briefed to stakeholders)
- Complex interaction? (multiple actors with competing interests)

If **NONE** apply: suggest expert judgment + Problem Restatement only. Confirm with user.
If **ANY** apply: proceed to technique selection.

### Step 2 — Stage Check

Map the conversation context to the appropriate phase:

| Situation | Start With |
|-----------|-----------|
| New project, no analysis yet | Launch → Customer Checklist + Issue Redefinition |
| Have data, need to evaluate | Diagnostic → KAC, ACH |
| Strong consensus exists | Challenge → What If?, Premortem |
| Need to model futures | Foresight → Counterfactual, Contrasting Narratives |
| Need to decide between options | Decision Support → Bowtie, Opportunities |

### Step 3 — Challenge Check (14-Question Rubric)

Questions 1–11 are always active. Questions 12–14 activate in `--comprehensive` mode.

| # | Condition | Primary Technique | Substitutes | Complements | Threshold |
|---|-----------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | Large data volume to sort? | Structured Brainstorming | — | feeds → KAC, ACH | — |
| 2 | Premises not explicit? | Key Assumptions Check | — | feeds → ACH, Devil's Advocacy | — |
| 3 | Multiple exclusive explanations? | ACH | Inconsistencies Finder (≤2 hyp) | ← KAC; → Deception Detection | ≤2 hyp → Inconsistencies; 3+ → ACH |
| 4 | High uncertainty, many variables? | Cross-Impact Matrix | — | + Alternative Futures (if forecasting) | — |
| 5 | Fear of surprise? | What If? Analysis | — | + Premortem (if existing judgment) | — |
| 6 | Groupthink or dominant mindset? | Premortem + Self-Critique | — | + Devil's Advocacy (stronger challenge) | — |
| 7 | Need to find opportunities? | Opportunities Incubator | — | — | — |
| 8 | Competing options to evaluate? | Bowtie Analysis | — | — | — |
| 9 | Competing narratives in play? | Contrasting Narratives | — | + Deception Detection (if adversarial) | — |
| 10 | Need to understand causal dynamics? | Counterfactual Reasoning | — | — | — |
| 11 | Need to track over time? | Include Monitoring Plan | — | — | — |
| 12 | Multiple plausible futures? ★ | Alternative Futures | — | feeds → Monitoring Plan | — |
| 13 | Need to model adversary reaction? ★ | Red Hat Analysis | — | + Devil's Advocacy | — |
| 14 | Risk of intentional deception? ★ | Deception Detection | — | revises → ACH/Inconsistencies | — |

★ = Comprehensive mode only

**Reading the interaction columns:**
- **Substitutes**: Use INSTEAD of primary when threshold applies (e.g., Inconsistencies Finder replaces ACH for ≤2 hypotheses)
- **Complements**: Use IN ADDITION to primary (e.g., Devil's Advocacy adds to Premortem when both Q2+Q6 match). Complements are recommendations, not automatic additions.
- **feeds →**: Output of this technique is input to the next (prerequisite relationship)
- **+ technique**: Consider running alongside (reinforcing relationship)
- **revises →**: Output may require re-running a prior technique

### Step 4 — Effort Check & Technique Cap

**Lean Mode** (`--lean`):
- Use ONLY Problem Restatement + KAC Quick + Inconsistencies Finder
- Overrides all rubric selections — no exceptions

**Default Mode** (no effort flag):
- Questions 1–11 active; max 5 techniques
- Prioritization when >5 match:
  1. Phase alignment (prefer techniques matching Stage Check result)
  2. Diagnostic before Challenge (test assumptions before stress-testing)
  3. Essential 8 before Extended techniques
- If >5 match, inform user: "I identified [N] matching techniques. Recommending [5 prioritized]. Use --comprehensive to run all."

**Comprehensive Mode** (`--comprehensive`):
- Full 14-question rubric (adds Q12–14: adversary reaction, deception risk, alternative futures)
- No technique cap — all matching techniques execute
- Complements from interaction model are promoted to selections (not just suggestions)

Present recommendation with rationale. Wait for user confirmation.

### No-Match Fallback

If zero Challenge Check questions match (or user requests minimal structure):

1. Problem Restatement (Launch)
2. Key Assumptions Check (Diagnostic)
3. Evidence collection
4. Inconsistencies Finder (≤2 hypotheses) or ACH (3+)
5. Premortem (Challenge)
6. Report with low-confidence flag

This ensures minimum viable rigor for edge cases.

## Guided Mode Phases

Execute in order, each phase building on the previous:

1. **Framing**: Customer Checklist → Issue Redefinition
2. **Assumptions**: Key Assumptions Check
3. **Evidence**: Read and execute `protocols/evidence-collector.md`
4. **Evidence Gate**: Execute the Evidence Sufficiency Gate (defined in `protocols/evidence-collector.md`). If hard checks fail, retry or halt. If soft checks fail, log flags and proceed.
5. **Core Analysis**: Use selection logic (Steps 2-3 above) to pick technique(s), then execute via the Technique Execution Contract (in-context for 1 technique, subagent dispatch for 2+)
6. **Stress Test**: Premortem + What If?
7. **Report**: Read and execute `protocols/report-generator.md`

---

## Direct Mode

1. Look up technique in the routing table
2. Create analysis directory
3. If OSINT not disabled, run evidence collector first
4. Execute Evidence Sufficiency Gate; if hard checks fail, retry or surface to analyst before proceeding
5. Execute the technique via the Technique Execution Contract (Direct mode always uses in-context execution since it's a single technique)
6. Present findings in conversation
7. Offer: "Would you like me to continue with a full analysis, or is this technique sufficient?"

---

## Resume Mode

1. Read `analyses/<id>/meta.md`
2. If analysis is **incomplete**: continue from last completed technique
3. If analysis is **complete**: read `analyses/<id>/monitoring-plan.md`, run fresh OSINT against indicators, update indicator status column and review log

---

## Iterate Mode

When `--iterate <id>` is detected (with or without a technique specifier):

1. Read the existing analysis at `analyses/<id>/`
2. Read `protocols/iteration-handler.md` and follow its steps in order

### Full Iteration (`--iterate <id>`)

Execute the complete iteration workflow:

1. **Detect iteration number** — iteration-handler Step 1
2. **Collect new evidence** — re-run OSINT via `protocols/evidence-collector.md` (unless `--no-osint`), iteration-handler Step 3
3. **Evidence Gate** — evaluate only the evidence delta (newly collected items), not the full accumulated registry. Techniques execute against the combined evidence base (prior + new).
4. **Archive ALL working artifacts** — iteration-handler Step 2
5. **Re-run all techniques** — use the same technique set from `meta.md`, iteration-handler Step 4, dispatched via the Technique Execution Contract (subagent dispatch for 2+ techniques)
6. **Cross-iteration synthesis** — iteration-handler Step 5, comparing new vs. prior findings
7. **Regenerate report** — include "Revision History" section from `templates/report-template.md`
8. **Update monitoring plan** — refresh indicators based on new findings
9. **Write iteration metadata** — iteration-handler Step 6
10. **Update meta.md** — iteration-handler Step 7
11. **Present delta summary** — show the analyst what changed, what remained stable, and what drove revisions

### Scoped Iteration (`--iterate <id> <technique>`)

Execute a targeted re-run of specific technique(s):

1. **Detect iteration number** — iteration-handler Step 1
2. **Optionally collect targeted evidence** — if the iteration trigger specifies a collection focus (e.g., "counter-evidence for pessimistic bias"), run evidence collection with that focus. Otherwise, skip.
3. **Evidence Gate** — evaluate only the evidence delta if new evidence was collected
4. **Archive only the specified technique's artifact(s)** — iteration-handler Step 2 (scoped)
5. **Re-run the specified technique(s)** — iteration-handler Step 4, dispatched via the Technique Execution Contract
6. **Cross-iteration synthesis** — compare new vs. prior findings for the re-run technique(s) only
7. **Write iteration findings summary** — in iteration metadata, NOT a full report regeneration (unless explicitly requested by the analyst)
8. **Update meta.md** — iteration-handler Step 7
9. **Present delta summary** — show what changed for the re-run technique(s)

---

## Evidence Gate (All Modes)

After evidence collection and before any technique execution, run the **Evidence Sufficiency Gate** defined in `protocols/evidence-collector.md`. This applies to Adaptive, Guided, and Direct modes.

- If hard checks fail: retry evidence collection or surface to analyst
- If soft checks fail: log flags in `meta.md` under Self-Correction > Layer 1 Flags, then proceed
- The Evidence Sufficiency Report should be included in the orchestrator's handoff to each technique

**Iteration Note**: In iterate mode, the sufficiency gate evaluates only the
evidence delta (newly collected items), not the full accumulated registry.
Techniques execute against the combined evidence base (prior + new).

---

## Technique Execution Contract

### Dispatch Decision

**Threshold rule**: If only 1 technique is selected (Direct mode), execute in-context to avoid subagent overhead. If 2+ techniques are selected, use subagent dispatch.

### In-Context Execution (1 technique)

1. **Read** the protocol file from the routing table
2. **Read** the template file from the routing table
3. **Execute** the protocol's SETUP → PRIME → EXECUTE → ARTIFACT → FINDINGS → HANDOFF steps
4. **Write** the artifact to `analyses/{{ANALYSIS_ID}}/working/{{ARTIFACT_NAME}}.md`
5. **Layer 1 Check** (silent): Did the protocol complete all required steps? Are all template sections filled? Any {{PLACEHOLDER}} tokens remaining unfilled?
6. If Layer 1 fails: re-execute the missed steps before proceeding
7. **Update** `meta.md` with technique completion status and `Dispatch: in-context`

### Subagent Dispatch (2+ techniques)

#### Dependency Tier Assignment

Assign each selected technique to a tier based on its input dependencies. Only include tiers that contain at least one selected technique.

| Tier | Techniques | Dependencies | Dispatch |
|------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| 0 (Launch) | customer-checklist, issue-redefinition, restatement | Conversation context only | **In-context** (interactive, produce `requirements.md`) |
| — | Evidence Collection | requirements.md | Existing subagent pipeline (unchanged) |
| 1 | brainstorm, kac | requirements.md, evidence-registry.md | Background, parallel |
| 2 | ach, cross-impact, inconsistencies | + assumptions.md, brainstorm.md | Background, parallel |
| 3 | what-if, counterfactual, narratives, bowtie, opportunities, deception | + prior technique outputs | Background, parallel |
| 4 | premortem, devils-advocacy, red-hat, alt-futures | ALL prior working/ artifacts | Background, parallel |

Within each tier, techniques run in parallel (no intra-tier dependencies). The orchestrator waits for all subagents in tier N to complete before dispatching tier N+1.

#### Dispatch Sequence

1. **Assign tiers**: Map each selected technique to its tier from the table above
2. **Tier 0**: Execute Launch techniques in-context (if selected) — these are interactive and produce `requirements.md`
3. **Evidence Collection**: Run existing evidence subagent pipeline (unchanged)
4. **For each tier (1 → 4)**, if that tier has selected techniques:
   a. Build the file manifest: list all files currently in `analyses/{{ANALYSIS_ID}}/working/`
   b. Construct one subagent prompt per technique using the template below
   c. Launch all tier subagents as background Task agents in parallel
   d. Wait for all tier subagents to complete
   e. Collect and validate each subagent's return summary
   f. If any subagent returns `FAILED`: log the error, skip that technique, add a Layer 1 flag
   g. If any subagent returns `PARTIAL`: log warnings, accept partial results, add a Layer 1 flag
   h. Update `meta.md` with each technique's status and dispatch tier
5. **Accumulate findings**: After all tiers complete, the main context holds only the compact summaries — not full technique work

#### Subagent Prompt Template

Each technique subagent receives this prompt (fill in the `{{VARIABLES}}`):

```
You are a structured analysis technique executor. Execute a single analytic technique and write the artifact to disk.

## Technique
- **Name**: {{TECHNIQUE_NAME}}
- **Protocol file**: {{PROTOCOL_PATH}} (relative to skill directory)
- **Template file**: {{TEMPLATE_PATH}} (relative to skill directory)
- **Artifact output**: analyses/{{ANALYSIS_ID}}/working/{{ARTIFACT_NAME}}.md

## Analysis Context
- **Analysis ID**: {{ANALYSIS_ID}}
- **Problem statement**: {{PROBLEM_STATEMENT_SUMMARY}}
- **Evidence sufficiency flags**: {{FLAGS_OR_NONE}}

## Available Working Files
{{FILE_MANIFEST — list of paths currently in working/}}

## Instructions

1. Read the protocol file and template file
2. Read working files as needed per the protocol's SETUP step
3. Execute ALL protocol steps: SETUP → PRIME → EXECUTE → ARTIFACT → FINDINGS → HANDOFF
4. For PRIME step: note the analytical posture internally (do not attempt user interaction)
5. Write the completed artifact to the output path above
6. Perform Layer 1 compliance check:
   - All protocol steps completed?
   - All template sections filled?
   - Any unfilled {{PLACEHOLDER}} tokens?
   - If Layer 1 fails: fix and re-write the artifact
7. Return ONLY this summary (nothing else):

Technique: {{TECHNIQUE_NAME}}
Artifact: analyses/{{ANALYSIS_ID}}/working/{{ARTIFACT_NAME}}.md
Status: COMPLETED | FAILED | PARTIAL
Layer1: PASS | FAIL (details)
Findings:
- [finding] [Confidence: High|Moderate|Low]
- [finding] [Confidence: High|Moderate|Low]
- [finding] [Confidence: High|Moderate|Low]
Handoff: [key outputs for downstream techniques, 1-2 sentences]
Errors: [any errors or "none"]

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT return full artifact content — only the summary above
- Every claim in the artifact must cite evidence from the registry or prior artifacts
- All paths are relative to the repository root
```

#### Return Contract

The orchestrator collects summaries from each subagent. Main context accumulates ONLY:
- Technique name + status + Layer 1 result
- 3-5 line findings summary with confidence levels
- Handoff notes (1-2 sentences)
- Artifact file path

This replaces full protocol execution in the main window. The report generator reads full artifacts from disk.
