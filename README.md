# Structured Analysis Skill for Claude Code

AI-augmented [Structured Analytic Techniques](https://www.cia.gov/resources/csi/static/Tradecraft-Primer-apr09.pdf) (SATs) from US Intelligence Community doctrine — implemented as an interactive Claude Code skill.

14 techniques across 5 analytical phases, with automated evidence gathering, three-layer self-correction, and mandatory citation enforcement.

## What is Structured Analysis?

Structured Analytic Techniques are rigorous methods developed by the US Intelligence Community to combat cognitive bias in high-stakes analysis. They emerged from decades of intelligence failures — Pearl Harbor, Iraq WMD — where the problem was never lack of information, but lack of structured challenge to dominant assumptions.

This skill brings SATs to Claude Code as an interactive `/analyze` command. Ask a question, and the skill orchestrates evidence gathering, technique selection, structured execution, self-correction, and a cited final report — all grounded in the [CIA Tradecraft Primer (2009)](docs/background/Tradecraft-Primer-apr09.pdf) and modern empirical updates.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and configured
- (Optional) [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev) MCP server for enhanced OSINT web scraping

### Install via Plugin (Recommended)

```bash
# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add blevene/structured-analysis-skill

# Install the plugin
/plugin install structured-analysis@blevene
```

That's it. Run `/analyze` to start your first analysis.

### Install via Git Clone

If you prefer to work from source (or want to contribute):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blevene/structured-analysis-skill.git
cd structured-analysis-skill
```

Then open Claude Code in the cloned directory — the skill is discovered automatically from the `skills/` directory.

### Manual Install (Non-Claude Code)

The skill files are plain Markdown — they work with any AI assistant that supports structured prompting. To use them manually:

1. Clone the repository (see above)
2. Open `skills/structured-analysis/analyze.md` — this is the skill entry point with all instructions
3. Feed the contents of `analyze.md` and `protocols/orchestrator.md` into your AI assistant as system context
4. For each technique, provide the relevant protocol file from `protocols/techniques/` and template from `templates/techniques/`
5. The `docs/library/` directory contains the full reference knowledge base if your assistant needs theoretical grounding

The key files to provide as context:
- `skills/structured-analysis/analyze.md` — orchestration instructions
- `skills/structured-analysis/protocols/orchestrator.md` — mode routing and technique selection
- `skills/structured-analysis/protocols/evidence-collector.md` — evidence gathering process
- `skills/structured-analysis/templates/report-template.md` — output structure
- `docs/library/00-prime.md` — master reference for all techniques

### Optional: OSINT Setup

For automated web research during evidence gathering, set up [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev):

```bash
claude mcp add firecrawl -e FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your-api-key -- npx -y firecrawl-mcp
```

Then whitelist the tools in `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "mcp__firecrawl__firecrawl_search",
      "mcp__firecrawl__firecrawl_scrape"
    ]
  }
}
```

Without Firecrawl, the skill falls back to WebSearch/WebFetch (whitelist `"WebSearch"` and `"WebFetch"` instead). Without any web tools, the skill still works — it just uses conversation context and local files only.

### First Analysis

```
/analyze What are the strategic implications of quantum computing for national cybersecurity?
```

The skill will:
1. Assess the problem and select appropriate techniques
2. Gather evidence from conversation context, local files, and web sources
3. Execute each technique with structured protocols
4. Self-correct through three validation layers
5. Present findings with a human review gate before finalization

Output is a structured report with cited key judgments, confidence levels, a monitoring plan, and full evidence registry.

## Using Local Evidence

The skill collects evidence from three tiers: conversation context, local files, and OSINT. To feed your own documents into the analysis:

**Mention files in your prompt:**

```
/analyze Should we migrate to Kubernetes?

Context:
- Architecture doc: docs/architecture.md
- Incident reports: reports/2025-Q4-incidents.csv
- Vendor proposal: proposals/cloud-native-migration.pdf
```

**Paste data directly** (becomes Tier 1 evidence, cited as `[User-provided, session context]`):

```
/analyze Is our Q4 revenue forecast realistic?

Key data points:
- Q3 revenue: $4.2M (up 12% QoQ)
- Pipeline coverage: 2.8x for Q4
- Two enterprise deals ($500K+) in final negotiation
- Competitor launched a price-cut campaign in October
```

**Place files in the working directory.** The evidence collector discovers relevant files in your project via Glob.

All tiers combine into a unified evidence registry. Use `--no-osint` to skip web research and rely solely on local evidence.

## Usage

### Modes

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/analyze` | Auto-select techniques based on problem characteristics |
| `/analyze ach` | Run a single named technique directly |
| `/analyze --guided` | Walk through all analytical phases step by step |
| `/analyze --lean` | Abbreviated technique set (fast, ~15 min) |
| `/analyze --resume <id>` | Continue or update a previous analysis |
| `/analyze --iterate <id>` | Re-run full analysis with new evidence |
| `/analyze --iterate <id> ach` | Re-run specific technique(s) only |

### Flags

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--lean` | Use only Problem Restatement + KAC Quick + Inconsistencies Finder |
| `--no-osint` | Disable web research — use only conversation context and local files |
| `--iterate <id>` | Re-run with artifact versioning and evidence delta tracking |

Flags combine: `/analyze --guided --no-osint` runs all phases without web research.

### Techniques

| Name | Technique | Phase |
|------|-----------|-------|
| `customer-checklist` | Customer Checklist | Launch |
| `issue-redefinition` | Issue Redefinition | Launch |
| `restatement` | Problem Restatement | Launch |
| `brainstorm` | Structured Brainstorming | Exploration |
| `kac` | Key Assumptions Check | Diagnostic |
| `ach` | Analysis of Competing Hypotheses | Diagnostic |
| `inconsistencies` | Inconsistencies Finder | Diagnostic |
| `cross-impact` | Cross-Impact Matrix | Diagnostic |
| `what-if` | What If? Analysis | Challenge |
| `premortem` | Premortem + Self-Critique | Challenge |
| `counterfactual` | Counterfactual Reasoning | Foresight |
| `narratives` | Contrasting Narratives | Foresight |
| `bowtie` | Bowtie Analysis | Decision Support |
| `opportunities` | Opportunities Incubator | Decision Support |

### Example Output

Running `/analyze ach` on a ransomware attribution problem produces:

```markdown
# Analysis of Competing Hypotheses: Ransomware Attribution

## Hypotheses
| ID | Hypothesis                        | Source            |
|----|-----------------------------------|-------------------|
| H1 | State-sponsored APT group         | OSINT reporting   |
| H2 | Criminal ransomware syndicate     | FBI flash alert   |
| H3 | Insider threat with external tool | User-provided     |
| H4 | Copycat using leaked tooling      | Analyst-derived   |

## Diagnosticity Matrix
| Evidence               | H1 | H2 | H3 | H4 | Diagnostic Value |
|------------------------|----|----|----|----|------------------|
| C2 infrastructure      | C  | C  | N  | C  | LOW              |
| Ransom note language   | I  | C  | N  | C  | HIGH             |
| Attack timing (holiday)| C  | C  | I  | C  | HIGH             |
| No data exfiltration   | I  | N  | C  | N  | HIGH             |

## Preliminary Findings
- Most plausible: H2 (Criminal syndicate) — fewest inconsistencies
- Confidence: MODERATE
- Key sensitivity: If "no exfiltration" evidence changes, H1 becomes viable
```

Every claim traces to a cited source. Every judgment traces to technique output.

### Iteration

When self-critique identifies weaknesses (missing hypotheses, evidence bias, untested assumptions), iterate without losing the reasoning trail:

```
/analyze --iterate 2026-02-15-cybersecurity-assessment ach
```

The iteration protocol:
- **Archives prior artifacts** as `working/ach-matrix.v1.md` — canonical names always point to latest
- **Accumulates evidence** — new items append with an `Iter` column tracking provenance
- **Compares findings** — cross-iteration synthesis tracks judgment revisions and confidence shifts
- **Records metadata** — each iteration logs its trigger, scope, and changes

First-run analyses are unaffected. Iteration tracking activates only on `--iterate`.

## Techniques by Phase

## Developer Guide

Everything below is for contributors and people who want to understand or modify the internals.

### Architecture

```
Question → Orchestrator → Evidence Collector → Technique(s) → Self-Correction → Report
                ↑                                                                  │
                └─── Iterate (--iterate) ← artifact versioning + evidence delta ───┘
```

**Orchestrator** — The [orchestrator protocol](skills/structured-analysis/protocols/orchestrator.md) handles mode detection, technique selection, and workflow management. In adaptive mode, it uses a 12-question rubric to match problem characteristics to appropriate techniques.

**Evidence Collector** — The [evidence collector](skills/structured-analysis/protocols/evidence-collector.md) gathers evidence across three tiers (conversation, local files, OSINT). OSINT uses a three-phase pipeline: foreground subagents scrape raw content to disk, background subagents extract structured evidence, then the main context integrates everything into the registry. This keeps raw web content out of the context window. MCP tools are only available in the main conversation and foreground subagents, not background subagents — the pipeline is designed around this constraint.

**Evidence Sufficiency Gate** — After collection, hard checks (minimum count, quality floor) can halt the analysis; soft checks (source diversity, diagnostic coverage, temporal recency) log warnings that surface in the report.

**Self-Correction** — Three layers: (1) protocol compliance after each technique, (2) analytical self-critique before report synthesis, (3) human review gate before finalization.

**Iteration Handler** — The [iteration handler](skills/structured-analysis/protocols/iteration-handler.md) manages artifact versioning, evidence delta tracking, and cross-iteration synthesis when re-running techniques.

**Report Generator** — The [report generator](skills/structured-analysis/protocols/report-generator.md) synthesizes technique outputs into a final assessment with confidence ratings, monitoring plan, and citation registry.

### Citation Methods
